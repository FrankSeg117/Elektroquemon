## Elektroquemón Project: Evolution-Based Game Using Logic Circuits, made in Logisim

This project involves designing and implementing a logic circuit that emulates the game Elektroquemón, developed in Logisim. The objective of the game is for the player to evolve from a primitive animal (Amoeba) to a more advanced one (Colobo) by attempting to stop a counter at the number 7 before it reaches 12. Depending on the difference between 7 and the number at which the counter stops, the player either advances to the next level or moves back.

## Technical Components
The project utilizes Flip-Flops and Finite State Machines (FSM) to manage the game levels and states, along with comparators, multiplexers, and buffers to control signal flow and ensure data integrity. It also features an interface allowing players to select difficulty levels and a button to control the counter.

## Objective and Outcomes
This project strengthened understanding in the theory and practice of FSMs and Flip-Flops, allowing for the application of sequential and combinational design concepts in an interactive game context.
